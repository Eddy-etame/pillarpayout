# PillarPayout Scalability Plan

## Infrastructure
- Use AWS EC2 instances with auto-scaling groups behind load balancers to handle variable traffic.
- Redis cluster setup for high availability and real-time data handling.
- PostgreSQL with read replicas to distribute read-heavy operations.

## Strategies
- Horizontal scaling of backend servers to support increasing concurrent users.
- Database sharding for PostgreSQL to manage large datasets and improve performance.
- Use of CDN (Cloudflare) to cache static assets and reduce server load.
- Optimize WebSocket connections to minimize latency and resource usage.

## Monitoring
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of system performance.
- Set up alerts for resource thresholds and anomalies.
